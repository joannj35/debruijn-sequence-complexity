## Overview
In this project we continue the study of the linear complexity of de Bruijn sequences over finite fields. Our aim is to establish the integer values of
linear complexity for which there exist de Bruijn sequences of given span over finite fields. **This repository includes the code developed for calculating these complexity distributions.**

## Research Domains
Our study is divided into two distinct research domains:
  
### Binary Fields
This section examines de Bruijn sequences within binary fields (prime field 2), focusing on sequences with spans of 6 and 7. The computation of the complexities utilizes ***multithreading*** and ***OpenMP*** to efficiently handle complex calculations and data processing.

***NOTE***:
Complexity 71 of span 7 is calculated in a different approach under the branch [Binary_Span7_71](https://github.com/joannj35/debruijn-sequence-complexity-distribution/tree/Binary_Span7_71)

### Non-Binary Fields
This section examines de Bruijn sequences within non-binary fields (prime fields 3,5,7), particularly focusing on sequences with span 2.

## Additional Tools and Visualization
For a more enhanced user experience, we have developed a (humble) GUI tool, housed in a separate repository. This GUI effectively visualizes the result data, providing a more intuitive understanding of the complexity distributions. For access to the GUI and further instructions, please refer to [GUI repository](https://github.com/joannj35/debruijn-sequence-parser).

## Using the Code
Each branch of this repository contains specific instructions and scripts for the respective domain. Please refer to the README files within each branch for detailed usage guidelines.

## Contributing
