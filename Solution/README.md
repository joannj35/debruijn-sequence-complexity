- `ComplexityToDebruijn` files compute the debruijn sequences over ***binary*** fields
- `NonBinary` files compute the debruijn sequences over ***non-binary*** fields
- `SequenceGenerator` files compute the sequences of small complexity for binary fields. The corresponding code for the nonbinary case is already included in `NonBinary` files.
